# Feltwillow

Felt-animal fables for children, each with a kind message, made with open
video models on the LUMI supercomputer, for the YouTube channel
*Feltwillow*.

Every story is a data file (`stories/<slug>/story.yaml`): a style bible,
frozen character and location descriptions, the narration, and scenes broken
into shots. The tools compose references and generate candidate clips; visual
review checks that the same characters and forest remain consistent across shots. Narration and character
voices come from Gemini TTS (`voice/`); music and sound effects (none used yet)
may come from ElevenLabs later; the final mix is done in DaVinci Resolve.

Current work: **The Lion and the Mouse, v5: all 186 clips rendered, owner selecting takes**
(status 2026-10-06). Start with the [v5 folder](stories/lion_and_mouse_v5/README.md)
and its [readable prompts](stories/lion_and_mouse_v5/prompts/). Versions v2 to v4 were removed on
2026-10-06 (they remain in git history); v5's script, bible and prompt records came from v4.
Next stories in preparation (script and shot plan ready for review): [The Tortoise and the Hare](stories/tortoise_and_hare_v1/README.md), [The Boy Who Cried Wolf](stories/boy_who_cried_wolf_v1/README.md) and [The Ugly Duckling](stories/ugly_duckling_v1/README.md).
The v5 stills are owner-made (ChatGPT Pro); the English narration exists; the runtime
`story.yaml` is exported by `production/export_runtime.py`.

**New here? See [Where to find things](#where-to-find-things) below.**

## How a story gets made

```
script + shot order review -> approved cast/places/props -> paired keyframes
-> individual pilot/clips -> owner take selection -> separately requested animatic -> post/edit
```

| Stage | Tool | What it produces |
|---|---|---|
| Story and prompt plan | `visual_bible.json`, `prompt_manifest.json`; runtime `story.yaml` from `production/export_runtime.py` | complete image/video prompts, state/geometry records and each accepted image's result; current render scripts require story YAML |
| Narration | `dialogue_coverage.json` + `voice/narrate_scenes.py`; `voice/` | the spoken lines; one WAV per scene with Gemini voices; `production/timing_sheet.py` maps lines to shots |
| Cast | `character/characters/<story>/<Name>/` | canonical, references, expressions |
| Places | `character/locations/<story>/<place>/` (bible `locations`) | empty plates, one per lighting; props |
| Scene stills | `character/characters/<story>/interactions/keyframes/` | the start and end image of every shot, recorded in the manifest |
| Shots | `production/shot.py` (`--fast`) | Wan 2.2 image-to-video between keyframes, one action per shot |
| Animatic (separate owner request) | `production/animatic.py` | assembly after actual take selection; source choices and dialogue timing need manual review |
| Post | `feltwillow/post.py` | RIFE 16->30 fps, Real-ESRGAN to 1080p, grade |

## Consistent images (start here before any image)

Every story keeps one visual bible (`stories/<slug>/visual_bible.json`): canonical character
descriptions written from the approved canonical images, the size lineup, locked location plates
and camera setups with measured character sizes. All image and video prompts in
`prompt_manifest.json` are templates built from it:

```bash
python3 production/image_prompts.py build   # render the templates
python3 production/image_prompts.py lint    # must report 0 errors
python3 production/image_prompts.py md      # readable prompts in stories/<slug>/prompts/
python3 production/image_prompts.py review <record> --image <candidate>   # side-by-side gate
python3 production/image_prompts.py --story lion_and_mouse_v5 new-story <slug>   # skeleton for a new story
```

Claude Code loads the repo skill `consistent-image-prompts` (`.claude/skills/`) for any image
work; it walks through the setup for a new story, prompt writing, generation and review.
Details: `docs/image-prompts.md`; rules: `docs/creation-rules.md` (CR-11 to CR-18).

To make an image yourself: `python3 production/image_prompts.py show <record>` (or
`stories/<slug>/prompts/*.md`) gives the exact prompt; attach the references it lists, in that
order.

## Layout

```
stories/     one folder per story: story.yaml, story.txt, narration/, packs/
production/  image_prompts, story_packet, export_runtime, shot, keyframe, timing_sheet, animatic
production/contracts/  pinned publishing contract (CONTRACT.lock + feltwillow-contracts/<version>/); never edit by hand
character/   characters/ and locations/ per story; gemini_image.py (optional)
voice/       Gemini TTS: tools, saved voices (cast/, narrators/), samples
feltwillow/        shared package: paths, ffmpeg helpers, Wan wrapper, post-processing
lumi/        site.sh (machine paths), container wrapper, venvs, task runner
docs/        guides, measured rules, findings, licensing, LUMI, provenance
work/        everything generated (git-ignored)
```

## Quick start (LUMI; existing v3 example)

```bash
cd /scratch/project_465002727/jelealro/feltwillow-production   # always from the repo root
W=lumi/run_in_container.sh
$W python production/shot.py --story lion_and_mouse_v5 --scene 1 --shot s01_explores --fast --dry-run
# GPU work: one command per line in a task file (commands run from the repo root)
sbatch --ntasks=3 --gpus-per-node=3 --mem=330G lumi/run_tasks.sbatch work/tasks/<name>.txt
# voices (no GPU)
source voice/gemini_env.sh && python voice/list_voices.py
```

V4 has no runnable `story.yaml` yet. These are command examples, not a v4 task list.
Pass the story slug explicitly; some tools default to v2.

Machine-specific paths (venvs, model cache, container, Slurm account) are all
in `lumi/site.sh`; nothing depends on the repo's folder name.
