"""Time a chained story's pieces from its narration (CR-21): the audio is the timeline.

  python3 production/chain_plan.py --story lion_and_mouse_v6 --audio-story lion_and_mouse_v5 suggest
  python3 production/chain_plan.py --story lion_and_mouse_v6 --audio-story lion_and_mouse_v5 check

Reads the narration timing (work/stories/<audio story>/audio/<lang>/timing.json, from
voice/narrate_scenes.py), the line list (stories/<story>/dialogue_coverage.json) and the pieces
(the shots of stories/<story>/prompt_manifest.json, each with `lines`).

How a piece gets its time. Inside a scene every line owns the span from its start to the next
line's start (the pause after it included; the last line also owns the scene's 1 s tail), so the
spans add up to the scene's audio exactly. A piece lists the lines it covers, in order;
consecutive pieces may share a line, and a shared line's span is split evenly between them. A
piece lasts the sum of its shares. Its clip length is the Wan length (4k+1 frames, 49 to 81 at
16 fps) closest to that, and the rest is a retime: speed = clip seconds / piece seconds, allowed
from 0.80 to 1.25 (RIFE in post). So a piece covers 2.45 s to 6.33 s; outside that, change the
plan (merge pieces or split a line over more pieces). Pieces are never trimmed: the cut-off part
would be the image the next piece starts on.

  suggest   every line with its span and the number of pieces it needs on its own (no pieces read)
  check     report coverage and bounds; exit 1 on an error. A `reuse` piece keeps its rendered
            frame count (81 for v5 clips), so it must last 4.05 to 6.33 s
  apply     check, then write each variant's `frames` into the manifest, and write
            stories/<story>/TIMING_SHEET.md and timing_plan.json (the edit plan: start, length,
            frames and speed of every piece; nothing is held or stretched)
